### Hi, I'm Alan ‚úåÔ∏è

I write code for a living, and even otherwise. [Frappe Books](http://github.com/frappe/books) is my day job.

Here's some non work things:
- I like coding. Here's a [vim plugin that can help manage your thoughts](https://github.com/18alantom/zettel.vim).
- I like writing. Here's a [blog post on building frontend frameworks](https://18alan.space/posts/how-hard-is-it-to-build-a-frontend-framework.html). Here's its [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35937464).
- I like taking pictures. Here's a [picture of a building](https://unsplash.com/photos/D1vAuVjxcK8).

I also like playing music, here's a [picture of me playing the guitar](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bCcrJ1Z6MDneQtkE9).
I haven't put out anything I've composed, for some reason that has been forever away, but hopefully someday ü§û
